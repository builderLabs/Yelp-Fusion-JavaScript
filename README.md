# Yelp-Fusion-JavaScript
A front-end/JavaScript approach to querying Yelp Fusion

Yelp's new Fusion API (to date) has been developed primarily with back-end use in mind.

Using a minimal Python back-end and JavaScript (AJAX) queries, I demonstrate
*one* (albeit imperfect) front-end workaround for those who might be interested
in returning Yelp search results directly to the browser for processing client-side.

Refer to: yelpFusionJS.md as the main document.
